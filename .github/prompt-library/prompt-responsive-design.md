# Responsive Design Prompt

1. Build layouts with fluid units (`clamp`, `vw`, percentage) and CSS flex/grid to adapt across breakpoints.
2. Use the shared spacing/radius tokens to maintain rhythm on all screen sizes.
3. Add media queries at 599px (handset), 959px (tablet), and 1279px (desktop) to align with Angular Material breakpoints.
4. Ensure interactive components remain touch-friendly: minimum tap target 44px, font size ≥ 16px.
5. Test dynamic layouts rendered from JSON definitions in both portrait and landscape orientations.
6. Update this prompt when new responsive utilities or libraries are introduced.
